## Getting Started

Welcome to the UW Greek Life house tester! The aim of this app is to provide easy and helpful assistance in your journey learning the many sororities and fraternities at the UWs names and locations

This app includes a variety of gamemodes including easy mode, a gamemode which randomly selects a house to name but shows all names on the map, intended for initially leaning the names. Hard mode, the same as before, but keeps the names hidden, intended for actual house testing. And finally, flash mode, a mode which flashes all house names on key entry, also intended to initially learn house names. There are many more intended features, so please make sure to check out our TODO

Please also check dependencies as this program will give error when running run.bat and will not function correctly

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

This program requires Java Oracle found [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk23-windows). Please download JDK-23 or sooner!

## TODO

- Add greek letter repository and translation so that there is no need to remember specific correct answers unique to this program

- Add a point and click gamemode so the name is provided and you select the house

- Add a point and click gamemode so the user can specifically select a house and name it rather than random selection
